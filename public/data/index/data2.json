He guided me through the basics and fundamentals which allowed me to apply that knowledge and tackle my own projects independently. Thanks to his support and encouragement, I scored an A in my SPM Sains Komputer. It was definitely a fun and engaging learning experience. In fact, thanks to his exposure and influence, I am now pursuing my degree in Computer Science! “",
